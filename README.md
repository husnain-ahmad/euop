European Basket Option Pricing Approaches

## Scope
This project is designed to fulfil the assessment requirements for the Machine Learning Engineer post at Multiverse 
Computing.

## Objective
The objective of this assessment task is to develop three different approaches from three different domains that can be 
used to value a stock option and then compare the results.

## Problem Statement
A neural network is to be designed for pricing the European Basket options under Black-Scholes assumptions. Once done, 
the prices predicted by the trained model are to be compared with a traditional numerical solver for option pricing. 
Lastly, the results of both the strategies are to be compared against an analytical solution for a single asset.
